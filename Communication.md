## Packet format

| Start byte | Packet ID | Command ID | Payload length | Payload data | Checksum | End byte |
| ---------- | --------- | ---------- | -------------- | ------------ | -------- | -------- |
|                                                                                           |

The maximum packet length is 256 bytes.

Multi-byte words are sent in little-endian order.

### Start byte
Length: 1 byte  
Description: Start byte (`SHD_START_BYTE`) is defined as `0x01`.

### Packet ID
Length: 1 byte  
Description: Packet ID counts in a loop from `0` to `255` and increments for packet sent. The reply sent by the STM32 must match this packet ID which the ESP8266 sent.

### Command ID
Length: 1 byte  
Description: Command ID used to define what the packet should do. Along with the packet ID, this should be matched in the reply. The following commands are defined:

| Command name            | ID     |
| ----------------------- | ------ |
| `SHD_SWITCH_CMD`        | `0x01` |
| `SHD_SWITCH_FADE_CMD`   | `0x02` |
| `SHD_POLL_CMD`          | `0x10` |
| `SHD_VERSION_CMD`       | `0x11` |
| `SHD_SETTINGS_CMD`      | `0x20` |
| `SHD_WARMUP_CMD`        | `0x21` |
| `SHD_CALIBRATION1_CMD`  | `0x30` |
| `SHD_CALIBRATION2_CMD`  | `0x31` |

Descriptions of commands can be found below.

### Payload length
Length: 1 byte  
Description: Describes the length of the payload data. This is not the total packet length.

### Payload data
Length: 249 maximum, does not need to be longer than command requires.  
Description: This contains the data defined by the command specification. Read below.

### Checksum
Length: 2 bytes  
Description: A simple 16-bit addition checksum. Add up all bytes of data from packet ID through to the last byte of payload data (start byte is excluded from checksum).

### End byte
Length: 1 byte  
Description: End byte (`SHD_END_BYTE`) is defined as `0x04`.

Payload length: 17 bytes  
Hardware version (16-bit): This differs from the stock firmware. Shelly dimmer 1 is defined as `0x00`. Shelly dimmer 2 is defined as `0x01`.  
Actual brightness (16-bit): What brightness the dimmer is currently set to. Valid values between 0 (off) and 1000 (fully on).  
Active power (32-bit): Used on the Shelly dimmer 1 and Shelly dimmer 2 when neutral is connected. Value is taken from raw PWM frequency from HLW8012 power measurment chip, thus acutal power in watts can be calculated as 880373 / power.  
Voltage (32-bit): Used on the Shelly dimmer 1 if patched (see https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota/issues/6914#issuecomment-691668208) and Shelly dimmer 2 when neutral is connected. Value is taken from raw PWM frequency from HLW8012 power measurment chip, thus voltage in volts can be calculated as 347800 / voltage.  
Current (32-bit): Used on the Shelly dimmer 1 and Shelly dimmer 2. Value is taken from raw PWM frequency from HLW8012 power measurment chip, thus current in amps can be calculated as 1448 / current.  
Leading edge (8-bit): This differs from the stock firmware. Reports the dimming mode currently being used. Trailing edge is defined as `0x00` (false) and leading edge is defined as `0x01` (true).
